# Required Javascript libraries

The following table provides a list of the required third party Javascript libraries.

All libraries have to be located in `src/main/resources/static/lib`. You have to recompile the whole project every time
you modify the contents of this folder.

**Alternativly to downloading all the required third party libraries you may also edit the index file and add them via
a cdn.**
